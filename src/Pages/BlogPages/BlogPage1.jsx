          <b>Does button CTA colour play a role in getting clicks?</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
          An eye-catching, high-contrast button is key to getting your users’
          attention, but that’s not all. The colour of the button is actually an
          important consideration in driving users to click. One study showed
          that people were more likely to click on buttons that matched their
          brand’s colour scheme. Another found that using red buttons generated
          more clicks than green or gray buttons. This is likely because our
          brains see red as a strong call to action, lending an urgency and
          level of importance to the button.&nbsp;

            Every colour has its own meaning and evokes a different emotion from
            the user. Using colours effectively will help you communicate with
            users in an easy way and ensure more conversions for your business.{" "}
          </span>
          Freshboost, our <a href="#">web agency,</a>, is dedicated to
          leveraging these color concepts and psychological principles to create
          visually appealing and highly effective CTA buttons, ultimately
          boosting conversion rate optimization (CRO) for our clients’ websites.

        <h3>
          <b>
            Choose a colour that fits in with the overall theme of your brand
          </b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you look at the buttons on your own website, or a website for a
          company you know well, most likely their button colours will match
          their brands. While this is not always true, it is often the case. For
          example, Amazon uses orange as their primary brand colour and they
          have orange buttons on their site. Google uses blue and yellow as
          primary colours and uses them on their buttons. The reason behind this
          is that we associate colours with feelings. The same way we might
          associate green with nature or red with love, we also associate
          certain colours with certain brands. So when you see that colour in
          the context of something else (ie a button), it helps us to connect it
          to the brand.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <b>Think about what emotions a colour could evoke in a user</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The colour of a button could have a huge impact on the experience of a
          user. A blue button might be associated with calmness, while a red one
          might be associated with urgency or passion. Think about it: when
          you’re at a hospital, do you see any red buttons? Probably not—red is
          usually reserved for dangerous or critical situations (like “emergency
          exit” or “do not press”). In contrast, if you see a blue button,
          you’re probably safe to press it.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, maybe you want your users to feel something other
          than safety or calmness. Maybe you want them to feel excited and
          energized by their shopping experience. In that case, orange and
          yellow are the colours for you—they’re stimulating and energetic! Or
          perhaps your users just need to be relaxed and feel like they’re in
          safe hands (for example, when using an app for banking): in that case,
          green is the colour for you, as it’s known to create feelings of
          serenity and reassurance.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <b>Take into consideration the colour of the font in the button </b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The colours you choose for buttons can affect their readability and
          accessibility, so it’s important to make sure that there’s enough
          contrast between the button and its text. Try to stick with black or
          white for your button copy so that the contrast is always clear and
          visible. Also, it’s best to avoid yellow, blue, or red buttons against
          white backgrounds; these colours are often associated with warning
          messages and can be distracting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Button colours can also coordinate or contrast with website fonts. You
          might want to use your brand’s colour for buttons, especially if it’s
          a bright colour that has a good deal of contrast. If you do this, try
          using a darker shade of the same colour for your button’s hover state
          so that it doesn’t become difficult to read when highlighted.
          Alternatively, you could go with a contrasting colour that pops nicely
          against the rest of the site: try using a complimentary colour scheme
          generator like Adobe colour CC to find different shades of colours
          that work well together.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <b>Choose contrasting colours to draw attention to the CTA buttons</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
          You’ve probably noticed that a lot of websites have buttons that stand
          out—typically in bright green or blue. It’s an easy way to draw
          attention to the call to action, and in many cases it can make a
          difference in the click-through rate. However, there’s a trick to this
          approach: it needs to be done subtly. This is especially true if the
          colour you choose is bold. A contrasting colour draws attention to the
          button, but if it’s too extreme, looks jarring and even aggressive. To
          prevent this from happening, use a complementary colour on a dark
          background, or shades of the same colour for subtle contrast on light
          backgrounds. This will give your button the attention-grabbing quality
          you’re looking for without making it look like you’re trying too hard.

          <b>Red CTA Buttons: For time-sensitive offers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Red is often associated with urgency, excitement, and passion. As a
          result, red CTA buttons can be highly effective at driving users to
          take action quickly. However, it’s important to use red cautiously, as
          it can also evoke negative emotions like anger or danger. To maximize
          the effectiveness of red CTA buttons, consider using them for
          time-sensitive offers or high-priority actions.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <b>Yellow CTA Buttons: For positive user experience</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Yellow is a stimulating, energetic color that can evoke feelings of
          happiness and optimism. Yellow CTA buttons can be a great choice for
          creating a positive user experience and encouraging engagement.
          However, due to its brightness, yellow can be difficult to read on
          certain backgrounds. Ensure that the text on your yellow CTA button is
          highly contrasting and easily visible to maximize its effectiveness.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <b>Blue CTA Buttons: Reliability and professionalism</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Blue is a popular choice for CTA buttons, as it is associated with
          feelings of calmness, trust, and stability. Blue CTA buttons can be
          especially effective for businesses looking to convey a sense of
          reliability and professionalism. To enhance the effectiveness of blue
          CTA buttons, use a contrasting text color to ensure readability and
          consider using different shades of blue for varying levels of urgency
          or importance.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <b>Green CTA Buttons: Health and Wellness brands</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Green is a versatile color for CTA buttons, often symbolizing growth,
          harmony, and freshness. Green CTA buttons can work well for
          eco-friendly brands or businesses promoting health and wellness. The
          soothing nature of green can also evoke feelings of trust and
          reassurance, making it an excellent choice for financial or
          security-related products and services. When using green CTA buttons,
          select a contrasting text color to maximize readability and consider
          varying shades for different levels of importance.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <b>Orange CTA Buttons: Creativity and innovation</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Orange CTA buttons can evoke enthusiasm, energy, and creativity. This
          vibrant color can be an excellent choice for businesses that want to
          create a sense of excitement and innovation. Orange CTA buttons can be
          especially effective for drawing attention to special promotions or
          limited-time offers. As with other colors, ensure that the text on
          your orange CTA button is highly contrasting and easily visible.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <b>Purple CTA Buttons: For luxury brands</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Purple CTA buttons can convey a sense of luxury, elegance, and
          sophistication. This color can be particularly effective for high-end
          products and services, or businesses that want to showcase their
          creativity and uniqueness. Purple CTA buttons can also evoke feelings
          of mystery and intrigue, which can help generate curiosity and drive
          users to take action. When using purple CTA buttons, choose a
          contrasting text color to ensure readability and select shades that
          match your brand’s image and tone.
